                 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the 
                 first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 
                 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

                 Find the difference between the sum of the squares 
                 of the first one hundred natural numbers and the 
                 square of the sum.

                If you are familiar with statistics, this is a measure of variance.
                This exercise was rather straight-forward.
