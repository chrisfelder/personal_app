<h2>What is a block?</h2>
<p>The simplest of Ruby closures, blocs are executable bits of code. Blocs are often
passed into a method as an attribute and interact with the method. Blocks are 
basically procs that are not saved.</p>

<h2>What is a proc?</h2>
<p>Similar to blocks, procs are reusable bits of code. Ruby achieves this by
saving the code as an object. If called within a method, the returned value of
the proc will terminate the current method and return the result of the proc.</p>

<h2>What are lambdas?</h2>
<p> Lambdas are similar to procs, they are reusable bits of code that are saved
as a variable. However, they also check the number of arguments passed, and
throw an error if they are not the same. Lambdas behave similar to methods in
that they return a value to the method in which they are called without
terminating the method.</p>

<h2>How does Ruby on Rails protect from CSRF attempts?</h2>
<p>Cross-Site Request Forgery are attempts by attackers to modify an
application state of an authenticated user often by having the user click on
an image or link with malicious code. Often the hidden code sends a request to a web
server with an active session such that the user is unaware.

Rails protects against these attacks in several ways.<br> <br>For example:<br>
<br>
By default the <i>resources</i> routing helper directs specific HTTP requests
to default actions (e.g., POST requests are routed to <i>create</i>).
Additionally, each rendered page includes the csrf_meta_tags method to invalidate
CSRF attempts. All requests to the web server are checked against a validation 
token to make sure they are legitimate requests from the client. This validation
token is provided by default in the application controller calling the
protect_from_forgery with: :exception method. In short,
Rails verifies that the received token matches that of the session token. Since
a CSRF does not contain the token, the request throws an exception. If sessions
are in use, it is also possible to sign the user out upon receiving an invalid
authentication token.
