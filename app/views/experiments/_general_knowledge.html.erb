<h2>What is the difference between overriding and overloading a method?</h2>
<p>
    Overriding a method typically involves creating a method in a child class
    with the same name and parameters as one found in a parent or superclass.
    The new method takes place of the parent class' method usually with different
    functionality.
    
    Overloading a method involves creating two or more methods of the same name
    with different parameters.
