<h1> Hi!</h1>

<p> Assuming you are here to learn more about who I am, let me take a moment to
share a few things with you.</p>

<p> I analyze data, I program, and I learn. Every day. In some capacity I've always
tried to learn something every day. However, when I read an AMA by
Neil deGrasse Tyson, he really drove this idea home.
</p>
<p>"I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the
world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others." -Neil deGrass Tyson
</p>
<p>
    Beautiful and Succinct. 
</p>
<p>
    Thanks to the combined effort of family, friends, and professors I have 
    had the privilege to learn quite a bit over my academic career. To these
    individuals, I am eternally grateful. 
</p>
<p> Outside of programming and analyzing data I have several hobbies.</p>
<p> I enjoy watching youtube entertainers such as

    and 
  <%= link_to "Yogscast", "http://www.youtube.com/user/BlueXephos" %>
  </p>
<p> Sips and Hat Films are my favorite yogscast members, though Sjin, Simon
    and Lewis are pretty awesome, as well.</p>
<p> I play the piano from time to time. I used to play for a religious organization
    but have since retired. I prefer classical and game pieces.</p>
<p> I love a range of music including Classic Rock, Classical music, Cool Jazz, 
      Pop, Rap, and (when I'm working out) Techno.
</p>
<p> When I have time I enjoy RPGs and Strategy games. Currently I am playing Civ 5,
    Civ Beyond, and a few others. Feel free to friend me on
    <%= link_to( "Steam", 'http://steamcommunity.com/id/cfelder' ) %>.
